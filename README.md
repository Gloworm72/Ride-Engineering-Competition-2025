# 🎢 Ride Engineering Competition 2025 – *"Abandon Ship!"*

![](https://github.com/Your_Repository_Name/Your_GIF_Name.gif)

## Overview

As part of the 2025 Ride Engineering Competition hosted at Ohio State University, our team from the Themed Entertainment Association @ Notre Dame designed and built a working **model flat ride** called **"Abandon Ship!"**, competing against 20 top engineering schools from across the country.

Our ride followed **ASTM F2291-24 standards** and included:

- Risk assessments
- Factory and site acceptance tests (FAT/SAT)
- Service and maintenance plans
- Full mechanical and electrical schematics
- Custom control systems

## 🛠 My Role – Controls Team Lead

I led the **controls engineering** effort for our three-motor system, managing all:

- **Electrical wiring**
- **Stepper motor logic**
- **Safety interlocks**
- **Control panel design**
- **IEC 61131-3 ladder logic programming**

### Key Contributions:

- Used [**OpenPLC**](https://www.openplcproject.com/) to develop the full industrial control system on an **Arduino Mega**, enabling realistic PLC programming without expensive hardware.
- Designed a dual NPN transistor circuit for **emergency stop interlocks**, where power is cut unless both hardware and software agree conditions are safe.
- Implemented full **ladder logic** for automatic and manual ride control — including jogging, soft stops, homing, and programmatic E-Stops.
- Wrote **100+ FAT/SAT test procedures**, simulating real-world commissioning of an industrial ride.

## 🏆 Award

Our team won **1st Place in Control Systems Design** thanks to the reliability, safety, and modularity of our PLC implementation. Our use of a professional ladder logic environment, emulating real-world industrial workflows, contributed to our success.
